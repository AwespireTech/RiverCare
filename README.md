# RiverCare

Rivercare is a Proof of Concept(PoC) project that explores how to use blockchain smart contract technology to endow rivers with identity, and using a Large Language Model (LLM)-based chat interface to makes the personalities of abstract entities more vivid.

The process of identity formation is achieved through a method based on DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) co-governance, combined with the concept of "care activities". Stewards must continuously participate in these care activities during the iteration process to get the proof of participation(SoulBound Token, SBT) and maintain the existence of the river's identity. In practice, a multi-signature wallet serves as the medium for exercising the rights and initiating transactions associated with this identity.

The project chooses Tezos as the demonstration blockchain. The proposed mechanism, while demonstrated using rivers, is also applicable to natural entities or groups, historical sites, landscapes, concepts, and even calls to action, etc. 


## Setup

To fully run this project, you need to get the five submodules up and running separately.\
Detailed setup instructions can be found in the README of each submodule.
